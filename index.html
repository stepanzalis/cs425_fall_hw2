            <h2>MY WORLD & VISION </h2>
            <p>The World always has had two sides. East and West. North and South. Evil and Good. Black & white. My
                passion is taking these kind of photos.
                I am trying to capture the moments which are exclusive and which are also often all around, but hard to
                notice in this hasty time.
                My vision is to share these moments with you. However, not also share, but also to create photos and
                memories you will remember.
