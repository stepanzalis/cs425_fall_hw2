### Static website for JD Photography (fake) 
### The task is to create a static website for a photographer with three pages:

1. **Home page**
   * The home/landing page will be the entry point of the website. At the top of the
     page, Mr. John wants you to add a banner, with a nice background and with the company‚Äôs
     name at the center (horizontally & vertically). Following the banner, the home page should
     have different sections that will include the company‚Äôs vision, a photo gallery (multiple
    columns) of previous work and testimonials from customers.
2. **About**
   * The about page will contain a short bio of Mr. John Doe. When viewed from the
     desktop, the page should be in two columns. The left should have Mr. John‚Äôs photo and on the
     right his bio. On mobile, the page must have one column, with the photo on top and the bio on
     the bottom.
3. **Contact**
   * The contact page should contain the address of the studio, working hours and a form
     for messaging Mr. John. The form should have fields for: name/surname, email, message
     subject and text. The form should also offer a way for someone to choose a meeting date/hour.
     We are NOT required to implement the functionality of the form.
